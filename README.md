## Usage/Examples

The UI shows one input. The user types "/1", a dropdown displays, if user keeps typing, the input will change styles to show a heading input. After the user enters the desired text and clicks enter, a heading with the text entered will be created and the input will reset to keep creating text elements.

The first time the user uses the input, am H1 tag will be created for the heading. After we have a heading, the following elements will be P tags from HTML.
